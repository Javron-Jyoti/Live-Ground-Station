# Ground Station Dashboard

My latest project focuses on creating a ground station dashboard for real-time data visualization using BMP180 and MPU6050 modules.

## Overview

### Integration
I started by integrating the BMP180 and MPU6050 modules with an Arduino Uno.

### Data Retrieval
Data was retrieved from the laptop port and recorded into an Excel sheet.

### Graph Creation
Real-time graphs were created based on the retrieved data.

### Dashboard Development
We compiled these graphs into an interactive dashboard.

## Interactive Graphs

The interactive graphs include:

1. **Pressure vs. Time** (scattered line plot)
2. **Temperature vs. Time** (scattered line plot)
3. **Altitude vs. Time** (scattered line plot)
4. **Temperature vs. Altitude** (scattered line plot)
5. **Pressure vs. Temperature** (bar plot)
6. **Ax, Ay, Az vs. Time** (multiple lines)
7. **Gx, Gy, Gz vs. Time** (bar + line plot)
8. **Pressure vs. Altitude** (scatter plot)

## How to Run

1. Integrate BMP180 and MPU6050 modules with an Arduino Uno.
2. Retrieve data from the laptop port and record it into an Excel sheet.
3. Use the provided scripts to create real-time graphs.
4. Compile these graphs into an interactive dashboard.
